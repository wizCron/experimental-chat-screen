# experimental chat screen
An experimental screen drawn in the terminal with symbols.

I created this screen as proof of concept. I also added a small player icon and simple controlls.

### Dependencies

Install python module keyboard, threading and time with `pip`:

```shell
pip install keyboard
pip install threading
pip install time
```

### How to run

Just start the chat-screen.py with any python 3 interpreter. The interpreter needs admin rights for the input to work. I use the mac terminal with sudo.
```shell
sudo python3 chat-screen.py
```

By default you can use the arrow keys to controll the player icon.
